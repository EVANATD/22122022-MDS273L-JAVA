Question:
Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.
Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple); if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".



Description:
This program takes input from the user such as name, age, state, gender, salary, and company, and then outputs some information about the employee based on 
that input.The program uses the Scanner class to get input from the user, and then uses if-else statements and switch statements to determine various information 
about the employee.For example, the program determines whether the employee is male or female based on the gender input, and then outputs a message accordingly. It
also determines which part of India the employee is coming from based on the state input, and then outputs a message accordingly. Finally, the program
determines whether the company the employee works for is one of the top MNCs, and then outputs a message accordingly.
