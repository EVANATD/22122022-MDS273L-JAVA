You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that can encrypt or decrypt a message that the user wishes to transfer.
Your program should have two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each function will accept a string message and return the encrypted or decrypted message.

Lab description:
The above Java programme uses a substitution cypher to construct a simple encryption and decryption system. The user can select to encrypt or decode a message or to exit the application using the program's menu-driven interface.
The three methods "getMessageFromUser", "encrypt", and "decrypt" are defined by the software. The user is asked to enter a message using the "getMessageFromUser" function, which then returns the line of text as a string. The "encrypt" method accepts a message as input, encrypts it using the substitution cypher specified by the "cypher" string, and then returns the resultant string as the encrypted message. The "decode" method accepts an encrypted message as an input, uses the substitution cipher's opposite to decrypt the message, and then returns the decrypted message as a string.The program uses a Scanner object to read user input and a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu and carry out the selected action until the user decides to quit the application.
Although this code offers a straightforward and practical implementation of a substitution cypher encryption/decryption system, it does have several drawbacks and might be improved for practical application.
