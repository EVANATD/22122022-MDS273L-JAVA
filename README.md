You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that can encrypt or decrypt a message that the user wishes to transfer.
Your program should have two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each function will accept a string message and return the encrypted or decrypted message.

LAB DESCRIPTION:
The program is a simple menu-based encryption/decryption tool. It provides the user with three options: 1) to encrypt a message, 2) to decrypt a message,
or 3) to exit the program. If the user selects option 1 or 2, they will be prompted to enter the message they want to encrypt/decrypt. The program uses a 
specific substitution cipher to perform the encryption/decryption. The encrypted/decrypted message will then be displayed to the user. The program will continue 
to run until the user selects option 3 to exit.
