Question:
Create a new folder in git named 'Lab 7' for the following question and solve the following: create a flowchart and document the results, constraints, etc., in the README.md file for the lab.Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.
Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].Present your results in the appropriate format and write the results in a file.

Description:
This programme reads the  information from a CSV file(Iris.csv) containing measurements of different flowers, analyses it, and computes summary including mean, median, mode, maximum, and minimum values of various parameters. These are then both written to a text file and shown on the terminal by the programme.The programme uses a  method named MEAN to find the mean of an array of numbers, a static method named MEDIAN to find the median of an array of numbers, a static method named mode to find the mode of an array of numbers, a static method named min to find the minimum value of an array of numbers, and a static method named max to find the maximum value of an array of numbers.A two-dimensional array of strings, the number of rows in the array, and a filename are passed to the show method along with the data read from the CSV file. It takes the numerical values from the array and computes the summary using the static techniques that were explained earlier. The summary data are shown on the console and are written to the file using a FileWriter object.The main method first reads the CSV file's contents into a two-dimensional array of strings, then it constructs three different arrays, one for each type of flower, to hold the data. The show method is then computed and display's the summary for both the total dataset as well as for each of flower.
